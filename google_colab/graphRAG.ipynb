            "\n",
            "**Description:** Acetaminophen (paracetamol), also commonly known as _Tylenol_, is the most commonly taken analgesic worldwide and is recommended as first-line therapy in pain conditions by the World Health Organization (WHO).[A176318] It is also used for its antipyretic effects, helping to reduce fever.[F4124] This drug was initially approved by the U.S. FDA in 1951 and is available in a variety of forms including syrup form, regular tablets, effervescent tablets, injection, suppository, and other forms.[L5756,L5774,F4124,Label]\r\n",
            "\r\n",
            "Acetaminophen is often found combined with other drugs in more than 600 over the counter (OTC) allergy medications, cold medications, sleep medications, pain relievers, and other products.[L5783] Confusion about dosing of this drug may be caused by the availability of different formulas, strengths, and dosage instructions for children of different ages.[L5783] Due to the possibility of fatal overdose and liver failure associated with the incorrect use of acetaminophen, it is important to follow current and available national and manufacturer dosing guidelines while this drug is taken or prescribed.[L5786,L5789,Label]\n",
            "\n",
            "**Clinical Details:**\n",
            "- **Indication:** In general, acetaminophen is used for the treatment of mild to moderate pain and reduction of fever.[F4124] It is available over the counter in various forms, the most common being oral forms.\r\n",
            "\r\n",
            "Acetaminophen _injection_ is indicated for the management of mild to moderate pain, the management of moderate to severe pain with adjunctive opioid analgesics, and the reduction of fever.[Label]\r\n",
            "\r\n",
            "Because of its low risk of causing allergic reactions, this drug can be administered in patients who are intolerant to salicylates and those with allergic tendencies, including bronchial asthmatics.[F4124] Specific dosing guidelines should be followed when administering acetaminophen to children.[L5780]\n",
            "- **Mechanism of Action:** According to its FDA labeling, acetaminophen's exact mechanism of action has not been fully established[Label] - despite this, it is often categorized alongside NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) due to its ability to inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways.[T518] It is thought to exert central actions which ultimately lead to the alleviation of pain symptoms.[T518]\r\n",
            "\r\n",
            "One theory is that acetaminophen increases the pain threshold by inhibiting two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2, which are involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Prostaglandins are responsible for eliciting pain sensations.[A176366] Acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, therefore, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory effects. Though acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the active site of this enzyme, studies have shown that acetaminophen (paracetamol) blocks COX indirectly.[F4133] Studies also suggest that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant type of the COX enzyme that is unique from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2.[A468] This enzyme has been referred to as _COX-3_. The antipyretic actions of acetaminophen are likely attributed to direct action on heat-regulating centers in the brain, resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating, and loss of body heat.[F4133] The exact mechanism of action of this drug is not fully understood at this time, but future research may contribute to deeper knowledge.[F4133]\n",

Death and the requirement of a liver transplant may also occur.[Label] Metabolism by the CYP2E1 pathway releases a toxic acetaminophen metabolite known as _N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine_(NAPQI).

In 2-year feeding studies, F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice consumed a diet containing acetaminophen up to 6,000 ppm. Female rats showed evidence of carcinogenic activity demonstrated by a higher incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia at doses 0.8 times the maximum human daily dose (MHDD). No evidence of carcinogenesis in male rats (0.7 times) or mice (1.2 to 1.4 times the MHDD) was noted.[Label] The clinical relevance of this finding in humans is unknown.\r\n",

Despite this finding, acetaminophen tested positive in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay as well as the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay using human lymphocytes. In published studies, acetaminophen has been reported to be clastogenic (disrupting chromosomes) when given a high dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day to the rat model (3.6 times the MHDD). No clastogenicity was observed at a dose of 750 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the MHDD), indicating that this drug has a threshold before it may cause mutagenesis.[Label] The clinical relevance of this finding in humans is unknown.\r\n",

No human clinical studies in pregnancy have been done to this date for intravenous acetaminophen.[Label] Use acetaminophen only when necessary during pregnancy.[Label] Epidemiological data on oral acetaminophen use in pregnant women demonstrate no increase in the risk of major congenital malformations.[Label] While prospective clinical studies examining the results of nursing with acetaminophen use have not been conducted, acetaminophen is found secreted in human milk at low concentrations after oral administration. Data from more than 15 nursing mothers taking acetaminophen was obtained, and the calculated daily dose of acetaminophen that reaches the infant is about 1 to 2% of the maternal dose. Caution should be observed when acetaminophen is taken by a nursing woman.[Label]\n",

The prevalence of allergic rhinitis in the United States is about 15% according to physician diagnoses, and up to 30%, according to self-reported nasal symptoms. Allergic rhinitis is associated with multiple missed or unproductive days at work and school, problems with sleep, and other difficulties with day to day activities for many individuals [A175057].

The antihistamine activity of cetirizine has been shown in a variety of animal and human models. _In vivo_ and _ex vivo_ animal models have shown insignificant anticholinergic and antiserotonergic effects. In clinical studies, however, dry mouth was found to be more frequent with cetirizine than with a placebo. In vitro receptor binding studies have demonstrated no detectable affinity of cetirizine for histamine receptors  other than the H1 receptors. Studies with radiolabeled cetirizine administration in the rat have demonstrated insignificant penetration into the brain. _Ex vivo_ studies in the mouse have shown that systemically administered cetirizine does not occupy cerebral H1 receptors significantly [FDA label].\n",

It is used as a photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy to eliminate abnormal blood vessels in wet form macular degeneration. Verteporfin accumulates in these abnormal blood vessels and, when stimulated by nonthermal red light with a wavelength of 693 nm in the presence of oxygen, produces highly reactive short-lived singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen radicals, resulting in local damage to the endothelium and blockage of the vessels.\n",

            "- **Mechanism of Action:** Verteporfin is transported in the plasma primarily by lipoproteins. Once verteporfin is activated by light in the presence of oxygen, highly reactive, short-lived singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen radicals are generated. Light activation of verteporfin results in local damage to neovascular endothelium, resulting in vessel occlusion. Damaged endothelium is known to release procoagulant and vasoactive factors through the lipo-oxygenase (leukotriene) and cyclo-oxygenase (eicosanoids such as thromboxane) pathways, resulting in platelet aggregation, fibrin clot formation and vasoconstriction. Verteporfin appears to somewhat preferentially accumulate in neovasculature, including choroidal neovasculature. However, animal models indicate that the drug is also present in the retina. As singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen radicals are cytotoxic, Verteporfin can also be used to destroy tumor cells.\n",

It is administered either topically or orally in conjunction with UV-A (the least damaging form of ultraviolet light) for phototherapy treatment of vitiligo and hand eczema. The photoactivated form produces interstrand linkages in DNA resulting in cell apoptosis. In research it can be conjugated to dyes for confocal microscopy and used to visualize sites of DNA damage.[3] The compound is has been explored for development of antisense oligonucleotides that can be cross-linked specifically to a mutant mRNA sequence without affecting normal transcripts differing at even a single base pair.\n",
